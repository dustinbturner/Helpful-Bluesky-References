This repository contains a curated collection of documentation resources for working with the Bluesky/AT Protocol ecosystem, specifically organized to support AI-assisted development environments and IDE integrations.

## üìö Documentation Contents

1. **AT Protocol Guide** (`atproto-guide.md`)
   - Comprehensive guide to building applications on AT Protocol
   - Covers authentication, user information fetching, network firehose listening
   - Includes step-by-step examples for creating custom schemas
   - Details about real-time updates and optimistic UI patterns

2. **Bluesky API Reference** (`bluesky-api-docs.md`)
   - Complete HTTP API reference for Bluesky and AT Protocol lexicons
   - Covers application APIs (app.bsky.*), chat APIs (chat.bsky.*)
   - Admin APIs and core AT Protocol endpoints
   - Documentation for public and authenticated endpoints

3. **OAuth Implementation Guide** (`oauth-client-implementation.md`)
   - Detailed guide for implementing AT Protocol OAuth "The Hard Way"
   - Perfect for SDK maintainers and developers with advanced OAuth needs
   - Covers web services, browser apps, and mobile/desktop implementations
   - Security considerations and best practices

4. **Bluesky OAuth Specification** (`bluesky-oauth.md`)
   - Authoritative specification for AT Protocol's OAuth profile
   - Details about client authentication, token management
   - Server metadata requirements and authorization flows
   - Security considerations and future protocol changes

## üéØ Purpose

These documents are specifically organized to provide context for AI-assisted development environments like Codeium. When indexed by AI systems, they provide comprehensive context for:

- Authentication implementation
- API endpoint usage
- OAuth flows
- Security best practices
- Protocol specifications

## üí° Usage with AI Development Tools

To use these documents with AI-assisted development tools:

1. Place these files in the root directory in your project
2. Ask the AI chat to index them for it's knowledge on future questions/problems
3. Use them as context when implementing Bluesky/AT Protocol features

For Codeium specifically:
- Include these docs in your project's workspace
- The AI will index them automatically
- Reference them when working on authentication and API integration

## üîÑ Updates

These documents are based on the AT Protocol and Bluesky specifications as of April 2024. As the protocol evolves, you may need to update these resources to maintain accuracy.

## üìù Contributing

Feel free to:
- Submit PRs for document updates
- Add additional relevant documentation
- Improve formatting or organization
- Report any inaccuracies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
